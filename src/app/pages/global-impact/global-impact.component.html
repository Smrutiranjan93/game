              Growth is rarely easy. Based on conversations with senior business
              leaders across industries, we sense an increasing recognition that
              it has never been more difficult to generate and sustain growth. To
              be clear, we are talking about growth driven by customer interest
              and market demand, rather than the temporary variety driven by
              acquisition, cost takeout or organizational restructuring. The
              bottom line is that not even top performers can expect that
              continuing to do what got them to market-leading positions will
              deliver the next phase of growth.

              Some of the common barriers – continuous cycles of tech-driven
              disruption, relentlessly fickle customers, talent mismatches – are
              well understood. However, less tangible and often overlooked factors
              – including lack of C-level clarity and confidence, short-term
              thinking and a history of unactioned strategies and plans – may be
              even more hostile to growth. Consider how senior leaders may lose
              faith in growth strategies when market opportunities shift more
              rapidly than the organization can pivot, refine its go-to-market
              approach or reallocate resources. Even when the right strategy is in
              place, limited ability to execute – or execute at the pace which
              growth now demands – may undercut returns.
